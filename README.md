<h2>About</h2>
This program web scrapes the product view page on Amazon and analyzes each product for and looks to see if there is a sale going on. The user can modify the Amazon link as needed to search for different products and categories. The user can specify the maximum and minimum discounts they are looking for and the program will only list products within that price range. For example, if the user sets the lowest_discount to 60 and the highest_discount to 100, then the program will look for products that have 60% off or higher. After the program has searched the entire page, then it will list the results in an Excel spreadsheet for easy viewing and record-keeping.
